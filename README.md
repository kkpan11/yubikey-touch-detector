# YubiKey touch detector

This is a tool that can detect when YubiKey is waiting for your touch. It is designed to be integrated with other UI components to display a visible indicator.

For example, an integration with [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) and [py3status](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status) looks like this:

## Installation

**This tool only works on Linux**. If you want to help implementing (at least partial) support for other OS, pull requests are very welcome!

On Arch Linux, you can install it with `pacman -S yubikey-touch-detector`

The package also installs a systemd service and socket. If you want the app to launch on startup, just enable the service like so:

```
$ systemctl --user daemon-reload
$ systemctl --user enable --now yubikey-touch-detector.service
```

If you want the service to be started only when there is a listener on Unix socket, enable the socket instead like so:

```
$ systemctl --user daemon-reload
$ systemctl --user enable --now yubikey-touch-detector.socket
```

Alternatively you can download the latest release from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/maximbaz/yubikey-touch-detector/releases) page. All releases are signed with [my PGP key](https://keybase.io/maximbaz).

Finally you can install the app with `go`:

### Prequisites for building locally

- gpgme

```
sudo apt install libgpgme-dev
```

- For Go <1.17

```
$ go get -u github.com/maximbaz/yubikey-touch-detector
```

- For [Go >1.17](https://go.dev/doc/go-get-install-deprecation):

```
$ go install github.com/maximbaz/yubikey-touch-detector@latest
```

This places the binary in your `$GOPATH/bin` folder, as well as the sources in `$GOPATH/src` for you to use the detection functions in your own code.

## Usage

#### Command line

To test how the app works, run it in verbose mode to print every event on STDERR:

```
$ yubikey-touch-detector -v
```

Now try different commands that require a physical touch and see if the app can successfully detect them.

#### Desktop notifications

You can make the app show desktop notifications using `libnotify` if you run it with corresponding flag:

```
$ yubikey-touch-detector --libnotify
```

#### Configuring the app

The app supports the following environment variables and CLI arguments (CLI args take precedence):

| Environment var                    | CLI arg       |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `YUBIKEY_TOUCH_DETECTOR_VERBOSE`   | `-v`          |
| `YUBIKEY_TOUCH_DETECTOR_LIBNOTIFY` | `--libnotify` |
| `YUBIKEY_TOUCH_DETECTOR_STDOUT`    | `--stdout`    |
| `YUBIKEY_TOUCH_DETECTOR_NOSOCKET`  | `--no-socket` |

You can configure the systemd service by defining any of these environment variables in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/yubikey-touch-detector/service.conf` - see `service.conf.example` for a configuration example.

#### Integrating with other UI components

First of all, make sure the app is always running (e.g. start a provided systemd user service or socket).

Next, in order to integrate the app with other UI components to display a visible indicator, use any of the available notifiers in the `notifier` subpackage.

##### notifier/unix_socket

`unix_socket` notifier allows anyone to connect to the socket `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/yubikey-touch-detector.socket` and receive the following events:

| event   | description                                         |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `GPG_1` | when a `gpg` operation started waiting for a touch  |
| `GPG_0` | when a `gpg` operation stopped waiting for a touch  |
| `U2F_1` | when a `u2f` operation started waiting for a touch  |
| `U2F_0` | when a `u2f` operation stopped waiting for a touch  |
| `MAC_1` | when a `hmac` operation started waiting for a touch |
| `MAC_0` | when a `hmac` operation stopped waiting for a touch |

All messages have a fixed length of 5 bytes to simplify the code on the receiving side.

## How it works

Your YubiKey may require a physical touch to confirm these operations:

- `sudo` request (via `pam-u2f`)
- [WebAuthn](https://webauthn.io/)
- `gpg --sign`
- `gpg --decrypt`
- `ssh` to a remote host (and related operations, such as `scp`, `rsync`, etc.)
- `ssh` on a remote host to a different remote host (via forwarded `ssh-agent`)
- `HMAC` operations

### Detecting u2f operations

In order to detect whether a U2F/FIDO2 operation requests a touch on YubiKey, the app is listening on the appropriate `/dev/hidraw*` device for corresponding messages as per FIDO spec.

See `detector/u2f.go` for more info on implementation details, the source code is documented and contains relevant links to the spec.

### Detecting gpg operations

This detection is based on a "busy check" - when the card is busy (i.e. `gpg --card-status` hangs), it is assumed that it is waiting on a touch. This of course leads to false positives, when the card is busy for other reasons, but it is a good guess anyway.

In order to not run the `gpg --card-status` indefinitely (which leads to YubiKey be constantly blinking), the check is being performed only after any shadowed private key files inside `$GNUPGHOME/private-keys-v1.d/*` are opened (the app is thus watching for `OPEN` events on those files).

> If the path to your `private-keys-v1.d` folder differs, define `$GNUPGHOME` environment variable, globally or in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/yubikey-touch-detector/service.conf`.

Since v1.11.0 we started using `gpgme` to perform some operations above:

- we are now using Assuan protocol to query card status, instead of spawning `gpg --card-status` processes.
- we are now querying path to `$GNUPGHOME` from `gpgme`.

### Detecting ssh operations

The requests performed on a local host will be captured by the `gpg` detector. However, in order to detect the use of forwarded `ssh-agent` on a remote host, an additional detector was introduced.

This detector runs as a proxy on the `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, it listens to all communications with that socket and starts a `gpg --card-status` check in case an event was captured.

### Detecting HMAC operations

This detection is based on the observation that a certain `/dev/hidraw*` device will disappear when YubiKey will start waiting for a HMAC, and reappear when it stops waiting for a touch.

## FAQ

#### How do I configure my YubiKey to require a physical touch?

For `sudo` requests with `pam-u2f`, please refer to the documentation on [Yubico/pam-u2f](https://github.com/Yubico/pam-u2f) and online guides (e.g. [official one](https://support.yubico.com/support/solutions/articles/15000011356-ubuntu-linux-login-guide-u2f)).

For `gpg` and `ssh` operations, install [ykman](https://github.com/Yubico/yubikey-manager) and use the following commands:

```
$ ykman openpgp set-touch sig on   # For sign operations
$ ykman openpgp set-touch enc on   # For decrypt operations
$ ykman openpgp set-touch aut on   # For ssh operations
```

If you are going to frequently use OpenPGP operations, `cached` or `cached-fixed` may be better for you. See more details [here](https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide#require-touch).

Make sure to unplug and plug back in your YubiKey after changing any of the options above.
